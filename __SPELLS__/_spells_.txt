Spells can be used seperatley from your main attack, and do not take up a turn. You will need to provide the correct Mana Point (MP) cost before
you use a spell, unless it is a passive spell in which case the effect is always active.

You may only have 1 spell equipped at a time. You may not swap spells in the middle of a battle.
